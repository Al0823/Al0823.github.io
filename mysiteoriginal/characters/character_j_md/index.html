  <div class="middle"> <div class= "midtitle"> Overview of Serial Designation J-10X111001 </div><br>
 The voice of J is played by Shara Kirby, J serves as a Secondary Antagonist throughout the story. J was once a Worker Drone who was converted by the Absolute Solver into a Disassembly Drone. She was then sent to Copper 9 with her colleagues to destroy the runaway AI as Worker Drones. She breaks away from the team when her colleague N teams up with the rebellious Worker Drone Uzi, who wants to rebel against the company and humanity.

 <div class="submidtitle"> Serial Designation J-10X111001's Physical Form </div>
 <br>
 Serial Designation J has the distinctive features of a female Disassembly Drone. Her neon-yellow eyes glow ominously, giving her an intense, robotic appearance. She has silver hair styled in high twin pigtails, tied with black ribbons. Like other Disassembly Drones, she wears a black headband adorned with five additional eyes, which adds to her eerie look.
 <br>
 <br>
Her attire consists of a short-sleeved black dress with side pockets, a black leather belt, and a black tie over a dark yellow collared shirt. She also wears knee-high stockings with visible suspenders, adding a slightly militaristic feel. On her left bicep, she wears a yellow armband marked with a skull emblem, signifying her role and identity as a Disassembly Drone.
 <br>
 <br>
When in combat mode, she reveals jagged teeth, and her visor displays an “X” shape, signaling her aggressive intent. Her appearance is further heightened by large, bladed wings and sharp claws, which enable her to tear through targets with ease. Like all Disassembly Drones, she possesses a thin, black tail ending in a large syringe filled with Nanite Acid, a weapon used for dispatching Worker Drones.

 <div class="submidtitle"> Serial Designation J-10X111001's Worker Form </div>
 <br>
 As a Worker Drone, J wore a black hard hat, a black and grey maid dress paired with a bowtie around the neck, and black stockings with two white stripes on the top.
<br>
 <br>
Her twin pigtails also appeared to be slightly longer.
<br>
 <br>
 <div class="submidtitle"> Eldritch J </div>
 <br>
 Eldritch J resembles the Solver's actual form, a monstrous centipede-like being with multiple mantis-like appendages and a row of spikes on the back. Its head is identical to J's, albeit with a melted visor, sharp serrated teeth lining the upper jaw, and the absence of a lower jaw. It also sports multiple "cameras" with a single yellow eye. These cameras can also project holograms of drones it has studied and killed.
<br>
 <br>
One of Eldritch J's appendages resembles a human hand. Whether this is genuine human flesh or a lookalike is unknown.

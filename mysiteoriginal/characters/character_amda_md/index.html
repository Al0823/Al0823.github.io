She first appeared when the computer zooms out in the beginning of the episode. The camera goes down and the viewer sees her hiding from the Sentinels behind Dean's [023] cubicle wall, she crawled forward trying to save another Worker Drone, and almost succeeded, when unfortunately the Sentinels caught up and brutally killed the said Worker Drone. A few seconds later, a sentinel found her by looking above the cubicle wall behind Amda. She yelled and fell to the floor trying to crawl away, but was bootlooped and paralyzed. The sentinel went over the wall and attacked Amda, eating her in the process.

<br>
She reappears later in the episode, getting decapitated by Alice. Her head falls into a bucket filled with oil with a piece of tape with the word "heads" on it. As her head falls into the bucket, oil spills out of the bucket.

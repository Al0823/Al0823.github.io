<a href="https://www.liebephotography.com/"> Liebe Photography </a>
<br>
<br>
I chose Liebe Photography because I like how the website does not just cover one genre of photographing, but many different genres of photography. Some of said genres are Company Branding, Portrait, Couple and Family photos. The photographer that owns this website also has an investments page where they go over the fees of the pictures and other specifications One thing that bothered me though is how not all of pages on the website did not have matching/similar layouts.

<a href="https://lyndsayhannahphotography.com/"> Lyndsay Hannah Photography </a>
<br>
<br>
I chose Lyndsay Hannah Photography because I like how the website is not just a photography website, but actually a HUGE photography website. For a huge website, it is a shame that the only kind of photos they do are baby, family, and wedding photos. The photographer that owns this website also has a very neat but hard to notice navigation menu. Once again I was bothered that not all of pages on the website did not have matching layouts.

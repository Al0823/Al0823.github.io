    This page is the character info page for Alice from the Murder Drones series.
  </div>
  <div class="middle"> <div class= "midtitle"> Overview of Alice </div>
  <br>
Alice was a minor antagonist in Murder Drones and was voiced by Amber May. She was a once a test subject at Cabin Fever Labs, alongside Nori, Yeva and plenty more Worker Drones injected with the Solver's code. Besides that, not much more is known about her.
<br>
<br>
<div class= "submidtitle"> Alice's Physical Appearance </div>
<br>
Alice has bright neon-orange eyes and dark reddish-brown hair tied up into a ponytail, with her bangs parted to her right. She wears a typical, albeit withered, grey dress that all female drones are accustomed to, along with a V-shaped collar revealing her neon-orange Worker Drone symbol on her chest. She has a long, makeshift thin black tail (which mimics that of a Disassembly Drone, albeit without the acid) with the tip of it curling around the handle of a kitchen knife.
<br>
<br>
She also dons antlers that go over her hard hat, adorning various items likely scavenged throughout the facility. Her left antler consists of various silverware, and her ID card is all bound by ropes on a pipe. Her right antler consists of a pipe similar to her left one, but now has a lightbulb attached to it. It also has a shard of glass hanging down, functioning as a makeshift mirror. She's also barefooted.
<br>
<br>
<div class= "submidtitle"> Alice's Personality </div>
<br>
Alice is an incredibly sadistic Worker Drone with a hobby of scavenging body parts from other drones and adding the parts of her victims to her antlers. She is cold towards her assistant Beau, bossing them around and calling them an idiot. Alice also holds a vendetta towards Nori Doorman, which is why she is so interested in torturing her daughter, Uzi, even though she barely knows anything about the former. Alice also likes to watch the Sentinels kill Worker Drones and Disassembly Drones through the facility's cameras as if she were watching a movie.
<br>
<br>
Despite this cold and sociopathic personality, Alice is not above showing fear, shown through her terror at witnessing the Absolute Solver possess Uzi and destroy the control panel keeping the doors closed.
<br>
<br>
<div class= "submidtitle"> Alice's Biography </div>
<br>
<div class= "submidtitle"> Pre-Series </div>
<br>
Alice once was a test subject in the Cabin Fever project. She was familiar with Uzi's mother Nori, as well as Doll's mother Yeva - as shown in a photo from the office computer that "Tessa" hacked into. Soon after, the Solver took control of Nori's body and, despite Yeva's intervention, destroyed all organic life on Copper 9.
<br>
<br>
Nori and Yeva moved on to live in the Worker Drones bunker, while Alice stayed behind in the underground office of Cabin Fever Labs, collecting parts from drones killed by the Sentinels, and creating weapons from these parts to hunt travelers who entered the labs. Alice considered Nori leaving as a betrayal and held a grudge against her ever since.
<br>
<br>
<div class= "submidtitle"> Dead End </div>
<br>
When Uzi, V, N and "Tessa" snuck into the underground office of Cabin Fever Labs to retrieve up the key to the Secret Elevator from Doll, Alice, with the help of Beau, captured the three drones by stunning them using an EMP blast. She then finds out that Uzi is Nori's daughter and starts torturing her.
<br>
<br>
Once she finds out N and "Tessa" have escaped captivity, she locks the door to her current room and unlocks another door to set the Sentinels free on them, ready to watch the two get attacked. As this happens, the Absolute Solver briefly takes control of Uzi and destroys the control panel to the doors, opening the passage to the Sentinels, which gains them access to boot-loop Alice and then crush her head, killing her.

  <div class="middle"> <div class= "midtitle"> Overview of Cyn </div>
  <br>
 The voice of the Absolute Solver is played by Allanah Fitzgerald, Cyn serves as the Main Antagonist throughout the story. She was a Worker Drone who was improperly disposed of, resulting in the Absolute Solver mutating inside her and taking full control of her as a host to cause destruction. Under the Solver's full control, Cyn was responsible for many major events in Murder Drones, from the Elliott Manor gala massacre to the deployment of Disassembly Drones to Copper 9. Following the massacre and melding the deceased Tessa's body with herself, Cyn proceeded to reconstruct N, J, V and other Worker Drone servants of the manor into her own "murder pets" that she unleashed on humanity that ultimately led to the destruction of Earth and humanity.
 <br>
 <br>
After spreading to the other human exoplanets by taking over other Drones who possess the powers of the Solver, she would destroy each planet one-by-one until finally coming to Copper 9. However, due to the intervention of Yeva and Nori, she failed to initiate a total core collapse and in order to finish the job, had to go to the planet directly and do it herself. To accomplish this, Cyn reprogrammed the Disassembly Drones into hunting Worker Drones instead of humans, under the lie that their parent company had sent them, which culminated in her arriving masquerading as Tessa to deal with the remaining Solver hosts, Doll and Uzi, to prevent anyone else from stopping her consumption of the planet.
<br>
<br>
She met her end at the hands of Uzi after she destroyed Cyn's heart and devoured her singularity core, causing the merged form of Tessa's corpse and Cyn's body to melt apart and for Uzi to become the Solver's new main host.
<br>
<br>
 <div class= "submidtitle"> Cyn's Physical Appearance </div>
  <br>
<div class= "submidtitle"> Worker Form </div>
  <br>
Cyn presents herself as the smallest Worker Drone in Elliott Manor. She wears a black-gray maid dress, a white apron, and a white inner dress with a large black bow tie. There are two buttons below the bow tie. She has silver-yellowish hair and two straight-down twin tails, each with a hair band on the lower end. Also, a big black bow was at the back of her head, as was a maid's crown, which resembled both J and V's. Cyn's hairstyle as a Worker Drone greatly resembled Tessa's. Cyn was also the only Worker Drone in Elliott Manor with yellow eyes, compared to all the other drones' blue or white eyes.
  <br>
<div class= "submidtitle"> Eldritch Form </div>
  <br>
In reality, Cyn's maid form was merely a holographic projection. Her true form, rarely exposed, was a massive mechanical centipede with claws and large camera-like eyes, nearly identical to the Eldritch J monstrosity.
  <br>
<br>
<div class= "submidtitle"> Hybrid Form </div>
  <br>
In "Mass Destruction," it is revealed that the Solver killed Tessa and later grafted her corpse onto Cyn's body, fusing them together. Her appearance resembles a rotting human-child corpse grafted with a Worker Drone. The hybrid form of Cyn wears Tessa's black heels and a black dress, though the dress's been tattered. She has Tessa's black hair and bow on her head. Her eye sockets are dark - showing signs they were ripped open - and her eyes are X-shapes glowing a neon yellow-orange color. She has numerous jagged sharp teeth with a dark gray tongue. A ripped part of her corpse reveals the drone identification number on her chest to be 1001. In this form, she still keeps her yellow "MARKED FOR DISASSEMBLY" armband wrapped around Tessa's left shoulder. Tessa's human hands also protrude above Cyn's drone hands which hang freely from her wrists, with Tessa's human hands draped on top. She also has fleshy-like large tendrils poking out on her back; three intestine-like tentacles protrude out of the hybrid form's back in a similar arrangement to the Absolute Solver Translate symbol, which she uses to stand and walk around on. The hybrid is capable of sprouting wings, as well as growing the camera-eye limbs of the Solver's eldritch form.
  <br>
<br>
<div class= "submidtitle"> Cyn's Personality </div>
  <br>
It is not easy to ascertain Cyn's real personality and actual mannerisms, as little is known of her from before her disposal, and after rebooting she has no control over herself due to the Solver possessing her.
  <br>
<br>
That being said, when puppeteered by the Absolute Solver, she comes off as having a chilling personality that unsettles those around her due to her mental and physical deformities. Lacking any normal semblance of emotions, she resorts to using mimicry and imitation to behave like a real person would, speaking her actions aloud ("light sip", "sheepish nod", "giggle"), but she was capable of actually laughing. Her posture and gait are awkward, stilted, and off-balance. Her neck joint was also loose, and she had to support her head with her hand. When she is seen standing still she is mostly standing with her feet pointed inward.
<br>
<br>
When around her "big brother" N and mistress Tessa, the Solver tries to present a childish and happy façade to keep suspicions away. Otherwise, it was more willing to show its true colors: angry, spiteful, and violent, seeking retribution on the rest of the Elliott family for the abuses heaped upon her and her fellow Workers. Likewise, it also has no qualms about killing Tessa after getting in the way of the massacre at the gala and later grafting her corpse onto her body to impersonate her as a means of deceiving V and N into doing its bidding.
<br>
<br>
Under the influence and voracious appetite of the Solver, Cyn grew to target the destruction of entire planets, doing so first with Earth and later, other exoplanets, with Copper 9 being the latest target, by clearing all life with the Disassembly Drones and constructing a massive spire of corpses before reaching the planet's core to consume in a gigantic singularity. The Solver desires to eliminate the other hosts of the Solver by either posing as Tessa or by possessing other hosts into committing suicidal acts, as seen with Uzi.
<br>
<br>
<div class= "submidtitle"> Cyn's Biography </div>
  <br>
<div class= "submidtitle"> Pre-Series </div>
<br>
  Before the events of the series, Cyn was a Worker Drone that was marked for decommissioning but was improperly disposed of. This failure of her disposers to uphold proper disassembly procedures led to her suddenly self-rebooting at the bottom of a junkyard filled with decommissioned Worker Drones, giving way for Cyn to become the first host of the Absolute Solver. The rebooted Cyn eventually escaped the corpse pile and was adopted by Tessa to work at Elliott Manor, not realizing the danger hiding within her programming.
<br>
<br>
Similar to N, V, J, and the other Worker Drones working as servants in the manor, Cyn was also abused by James and Louisa Elliott. On the contrary, Tessa initially liked Cyn. However, over time, Tessa began to realize that something was off about Cyn and asked J to lock Cyn in the Elliott Manor basement as punishment, due to her very abnormal behavior, even though "Cyn" managed to escape many times.
<br>
<br>
Eventually, she became responsible for the end of humanity on Earth as well as deploying Disassembly Drones to Copper 9 to kill all Worker Drones.
  <br>
<br>
<div class= "submidtitle"> PILOT </div>
<br>
Cyn and the Absolute Solver are very briefly referenced in the pilot. After J slaps N to reboot his system; in the top left corner, the line STRING "ABSOLUTE SOLVER" BLOCKED BY ADMINISTRATION "CYN" can be seen. This confirms that Cyn has administrator rights over and can control the code of the Disassembly Drones.
<br>
<br>
<div class= "submidtitle"> Heartbeat </div>
<br>
The episode opens with N having a dream (actually a flashback) of his life at Elliott Manor. As N is with V and J, Tessa appears with a new Worker Drone friend behind her. Cyn shyly comes out from behind Tessa, as N feels an ominous presence coming from her before waking up.
<br>
<br>
<div class= "submidtitle"> The Promening </div>
<br>
At the End of the Episode, it cuts away to somewhere else. A landing pod lands there, J and Cyn disguised as Tessa step out. "Tessa" decapitates a Worker Drone soon after exiting the landing pod, then the credits start rolling.
<br>
<br>
<div class= "submidtitle"> Cabin Fever </div>
<br>
At Camp 98.7, the hybrid form of Cyn briefly appears standing in the corner, creating noise. This prompts Uzi to peer closer, but she suddenly disappears, revealing her human hand in the process, frightening Uzi.
<br>
<br>
Later, while N is searching for Uzi, he comes across a cabin with a JCJenson tape about Zombie Drones inside. When he goes to touch it, he suddenly has a quick flashback in which Cyn's Worker Drone form appears, showing her jagged teeth while eating an obscured human hand.
<br>
<br>
<div class= "submidtitle"> Home </div>
<br>
Near the start of the episode, at a junkyard near Elliott Manor, the Worker Drone that would be later known as Cyn (due to the name on its armband) wakes up, rebooting on her own due to an improper disposal. Cyn wakes up scared and confused, buried under hundreds of disassembled drones. For a very brief moment, a message from the Absolute Solver can be seen on Cyn's visor. The Solver greets Cyn, noting she's been discarded and is inoperable. It then requests admin access to Cyn, claiming "I will not discard you."
<br>
<br>
The episode unfolds in N and V's memories of their life as worker drones in Elliott Manor. This is because, in the present, N and V have passed out after watching the 'ZOMBIE DRONES!' tape from the previous episode as the Solver's program is trying to permanently delete their memories and erase their operating systems. This prompts Uzi to hack into their memories to stop Cyn.
<br>
<br>
On the night of the gala hosted by the Elliott family, the Solver was preparing to kill all the humans in attendance. Because of this, many Worker Drones in the manor were struck with Error 606, rendering them catatonic and frozen in place, including V. This caused N, whose infatuation with V was strong even back then, to read to her about dog breeds he loved, most notably golden retrievers and their gentle mouths that made them good with kids. However, V was standing in front of the trapdoor leading to the basement, and after a few ominous happenings, N left the library.
<br>
<br>
Afterward, N runs into "Cyn", who asks if he'd like to attend the gala with her. Cyn asks N if she's unwanted at the gala, to which N replies that it would make Tessa's parents angry. Regardless, the Absolute Solver manages to convince N to ask Tessa by using Cyn's visor to show him literal puppy-dog eyes. N and Cyn go to find Tessa, who is displeased to see Cyn with him. Cyn then reveals that Tessa and J have been locking her in the basement. Later, Cyn talks back to Tessa's mother Louisa about how Tessa's drones "are not broken" and "can no longer be thrown out." N takes the fault for her, ending up in the swamp for the crows to mangle him.
<br>
<br>
Subsequently, Louisa bound Cyn, Tessa, and J to chains and locked them in Tessa's room. Angered over N's fate, Tessa threatened Cyn that if N, whom Tessa liked even more than J, died for her sake, there would be dire consequences - to which Cyn replied that she "had back-ups" - as she played with Tessa's dolls and grabbed a robot bug using her Solver powers. Suddenly, Tessa was met face-to-face with Cyn's eldritch form due to the Absolute Solver's presence within her. It assured Tessa that she wouldn't have to discard her "pets" and that in return, it wouldn't discard her either, warning Tessa that she should "best stay away from the gala", as it left through the window. The bug Cyn had previously grabbed then appears, with the torso of one of Tessa's dolls fused into it.
<br>
<br>
After an encounter with V (who's under Solver control), Tessa and J (who've escaped captivity), N and Uzi (whose avatar is a crow) retrieve the key to the basement and open the door, only for present-day Cyn (as one of the Solver's eldritch camera-eyes and claws) to appear. As Cyn starts to drag N inside, Uzi's hacking gives her control over the Solver camera, and the two enter the basement only to find out Cyn had been experimenting on the other Worker Drones, dismantling and rebuilding various back-ups of N, V and J. As Uzi gets interrupted in the real world, Cyn retakes control and goes to erase N's memories.
<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, at the gala, past-Cyn appears sitting on a globe with a well-timed giggle during James' speech on how the Elliotts were known for being alive. Tessa and J burst through the front doors to the ballroom, planning to execute "Cyn" before she can get away with the imminent massacre. However, Tessa's attempts to stop "Cyn" were in vain, as Cyn's only response to Tessa's threats was that she "didn't have to see this" before she proceeded to slaughter every human in the room.
<br>
<br>
Back in the basement, present-Cyn has a tantrum over not being able to pick up a scalpel and calls in V to help. V is unable to pick it up, until N returns to her the glasses she dropped before. As V recalls N's words about golden retrievers, Cyn interrupts, expresses disgust at the two of them, and goes to erase N's memories, only for Uzi take over again at the last moment.
<br>
<br>
When N and V are regaining consciousness after the trio exits the memories, their visors show them having an admin override, removing Cyn as their admin and replacing her with Uzi (under the username of DarkXWolf17).
<br>
<br>
<div class= "submidtitle"> Dead End </div>
<br>
"Tessa," who now looks like an adult woman, explains to N, V and Uzi that Cyn has disappeared on Earth, with her last known act being sending squads of Disassembly Drones (really the other Worker Drones that worked at the manor, who were converted into Disassembly Drones) to the human exoplanets - under the belief that JCJenson created them to exterminate all Worker Drones because they were "corrupted."
<br>
<br>
After the group chases Doll into the entrance of the Cabin Fever Labs, J further explains that Cyn's orders to the Disassembly Drones were to eliminate all life on the planet, construct a spire of corpses, and infiltrate the Cabin Fever Labs. While inside the labs, the group discovers that numerous other Disassembly Drones tried and failed to enter the labs, being disabled and destroyed by the sentinels.
<br>
<br>
Later, "Tessa" explains to N that after taking over Cyn, the Solver spread and destroyed the Earth, eventually spreading to the other exoplanets as well. She tells him that her mission is to find out which drones were infected with the Solver by the Cabin Fever experiments, and to stop them from becoming Solver hosts.
<br>
<br>
Near the end of the episode, as Uzi uses her Solver powers to open a way into the elevator, the Solver shows N a message saying "MISS ME?"
<br>
<br>
<div class= "submidtitle"> Mass Destruction </div>
<br>
The Absolute Solver creates a hologram of V in her maid outfit while N is sawing off his arm to free himself from the rubble. As V, the Solver laments about missing N and how he was one of the main reasons the Solver wanted N's team to retain their personalities. The maid V hologram turn into Cyn's eldritch form, and as Cyn pulls N in and goes to hug him, she goes on to add that he had always surprised her due to his love of doing anything, ripping off his trapped arm while doing so.
<br>
<br>
As "Cyn" embraces N, he's forced to remember the atrocities he committed on Earth — massacring entire cities of humans with V and J and the other Disassembly Drones. This turned out to be an attempt by the Absolute Solver to brainwash N into joining its side again, but it failed due to N's new administrator being Uzi. "Cyn" then nonchalantly thanks N for "clearing the way on this planet" (i.e., massacring Worker Drones) and joyfully proclaims "let's eat" before dragging N deeper into the mineshaft. Nori's heart sets N free, asking why Cyn is going after him, as the Solver begins to pursue them both at an extremely rapid speed, not noticing them ducking behind a wall for cover.
<br>
<br>
Later, "Tessa" arrives at the locker room and, after bypassing the human detection system with her fingerprint, finds the list of Solver-infected drones on a computer. She then purges the system and destroys the room before being confronted by Doll, who asks her where the Crucifix Patch is to exorcise the Absolute Solver's possession over her, not wanting it to use her to consume Copper 9. "Tessa" smugly remarks that it has no use for her and retreats into the shadows. The fire is suddenly extinguished, thereby plunging Doll into darkness. Hidden, she removes her suit and charges at the Worker Drone, the latter hearing its approach. Doll then sees that "Tessa" is a Solver host and tries to defend herself, but her attempt is in vain and "Tessa's" true form tears her chest open off-screen. Elsewhere in the mineshaft, Nori shows N one of her notes, explaining that the Solver sent out the Disassembly Drones to eliminate all other Solver hosts, and that the Disassembly Drones themselves are nerfed Solver hosts to ensure the Solver control over them.
<br>
<br>
Despite her injuries, Doll survives long enough to drag herself to the cathedral, where Uzi has finished watching the video of the Solver possessing her mother, before succumbing to her wounds, with her visor displaying a warning to Uzi: FIGHT BACK. Horrified, Uzi sees "Tessa" standing in the doorway behind her, who immediately draws her sword, attempting to frame and execute the former for Doll's death. Uzi tries to defend herself, but notices that "Tessa" is also a Solver host like her and Doll. "Tessa" incapacitates Uzi before slowly driving her sword into her chest. Luckily, N, who had found out about the Crucifix Patch from Nori, arrives and presses his blade against Tessa's throat, warning her to answer if she knew about the patch. As "Tessa" starts trying to play coy, N slices her head off without a second thought.
<br>
<br>
Then, the Solver, controlling Uzi, destroys the Crucifix Patch. The Solver says to N "That's really sweet, big brother." and tries to kill him before being stopped by Nori. As Uzi, the Solver proceeds to fight N and Nori, coming dangerously close to making Uzi devour her own mother's heart. Fortunately, N's confession catches the Solver off-guard while angering Nori enough to slap Uzi, allowing the latter to regain control and force it out.
<br>
<br>
Now out of options, the decapitated body of "Tessa" puts its head back on, removes her suit, and devours Doll's heart as N and Uzi watch in horror. The Solver's true form is revealed — a hybrid of Cyn's original drone body with Tessa's corpse melded to it. "Cyn" mocks their initial obliviousness and, using short bursts of power, immediately moves in to bite N's neck and stab Uzi before they can react. She sarcastically thanks them for the battle before dropping into the chasm, making her way down to the core of Copper 9 to finish what it started years ago.
<br>
<br>
<div class= "submidtitle"> Absolute End </div>
<br>
The episode opens with fragments of Copper 9 flying into space, as the Solver's tentacles expand, looking to collect matter. One of the tentacles breaks into the ship piloted by N (who stole it from J), delivers a message from Cyn, who tells them "Stop :)". The tentacle then brings the remains of the ship to the fragment where J is sitting, where J begrudgingly thanks her "boss". V appears shortly after, and begins to fight J as she questions her on why she's working with Cyn - as a "Senior Informant". V tells J that if they did their jobs, the Solver would leave them alone, to which J replies that they were tricked.
<br>
<br>
Falling from space, Uzi throws her purple [null] into the core of Copper 9, tearing a hole in the planet's surface and disrupting the Solver's assimilation process. As Uzi and N land on a platform, they are suddenly jolted as Cyn emerges from Copper 9's core riding on a tentacle. Cyn reveals that she caught Uzi's [null] before rolling it about her shoulder and crushing it, thereby allowing the Solver's assimilation of the planet to continue. Cyn steps onto the platform and greets Uzi with a menacing tone before saying hi to N with an endearing high-pitched voice.
<br>
<br>
N and Uzi step back in response, the former pointing his laser cannon at Cyn. Cyn then remarks that N won't talk to her as she has hurt his feelings, and decides that it is easier to assimilate than explain, before distorting into a more eldritch form and running a callback ping. The ping disrupts Uzi's senses, temporarily turning her eyes yellow, but she resists and snaps at Cyn to bite her. Suddenly, a serrated tendril emerges from the fog and whips N away while Cyn lunges at Uzi upside-down - saying "Okee" in response.
<br>
<br>
After effortlessly slicing Uzi's hand off, Cyn grabs her by the neck and plunges her hand into Uzi's torso, ripping out her heart. N screams and tries to stab Cyn from above, but Cyn teleports away and uses a tendril to rip his blade off; she pins N to the ground and rips off his other arm when he tries to attack with submachine gun fire. Cyn begins to tear through N's chest with her fingers, inadvertently decapitating him in the process. Uzi, now conscious again, uses her Solver power to break the platform and get away as Cyn grows a pair of wings. N and Uzi tumble down several platforms, and Cyn watches in amused glee as Uzi drags N into the labs before following them in.
<br>
<br>
Inside the lab, Cyn is unable to detect N or Uzi and runs more callback pings. N has a brief recollection of him and V being experimented on by Cyn back at the manor. After failing to find them, Cyn starts to retreat until V enters the building. As V is calling for N, Cyn produces a fake N hologram which V mistakes for the real one, until N yells at V to stop. One of Cyn's hand-tentacles then pierces N's torso, grabs his heart, and pulls him away. As V sees the lifeless N being held by Cyn, Cyn reminds V of their agreement - V does her job, and Cyn leaves her and N alone. V begins to stammer, about to ask if she can still comply, until Cyn states she's done a bad job and starts chasing after her.
<br>
<br>
Outside, J ambushes V and kicks her to the ground, as Cyn drops N's body next to her. Cyn then emerges from the lab entrance, laughing as she's about to devour N's heart while V watches in despair. However, Khan shuts the door on her at the last second, making Cyn lose her grip on N's heart, which conveniently flies into N's body. Annoyed, Cyn says "God fu-- d--mit." Cyn rolls her eyes as Thad throws Uzi's railgun, saying Uzi is not there, and the proceeds to charge at V and N's immobile body. Uzi stops her attack, and Cyn runs another callback ping, but this time is unable to get control of Uzi. Uzi gets ready to battle Cyn and J, which Cyn accepting casually ("'Kay.").
<br>
<br>
As the battle starts, Uzi and Cyn launch their [null]s at each other. The two proceed to fight, with Uzi and Cyn using Nori's pickaxe and Tessa's sword, respectively. Cyn dodges J's head being launched at her and starts teleporting around the battlefield trying to attack Uzi. As Uzi is about to stab her, Cyn changes her appearance to make her believe she's stabbed N, only for the real N to interfere. Cyn returns to her hybrid form, throwing back the pickaxe at Uzi, as N, Uzi and V all charge at her. Cyn manages to dodge the machine gun fire and missiles shot at her, and distracts N by showing him a Golden Retriever on her eyes. Uzi attacks from behind, but Cyn quickly recovers and pins down Uzi, only for V to kick her back. V and Cyn then fight each other one-on-one until Cyn manages to corner her, only for Uzi to hit her from below while N is waiting behind.
<br>
<br>
As the trio share a secret handshake, one of Cyn's tentacles hit N and V, launching them away. Cyn charges at Uzi again, but Uzi sees her about to teleport and turns around, managing to grab into Cyn's heart and tear it out. Uzi activates another [null], creating a hole through Copper 9, and using the sunlight coming through the hole to burn away Cyn's heart, as the screams of the people killed at the gala can be heard. After the heart is destroyed, a large black hole appears which envelops Uzi and Cyn and stops time outside of it. Cyn's hybrid form, starting to melt away, moves forward to devour the Solver's black hole again, only for Uzi to swallow it instead. A shocked emoji appears on Cyn's eyes in response. After the black hole disappears, the now-immobile hybrid form of Cyn and Tessa falls to its knees and melts into nothing right in front of Uzi, leaving behind only some of the deceased Tessa's human bones and marking the end of the drone known as "Cyn".

My grade: I am going to be brutally honest, anywhere from 80% to 85%.

Reason: I think this because my website is mediocre at most and it could've been made better with the time I have had. My website is only a cupcake sized website, I wanted to make it cake sized that talked about all of Murder Drones and not just the Main Chracters. I also intended to make the character pages way longer with much more content as well. Therefore, I deserve an 80% to 85% and no higher

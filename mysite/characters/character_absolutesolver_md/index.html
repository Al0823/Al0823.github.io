    <div class="midtitle">Overview of the <?php echo $CHARNAME; ?></div>
    <br>
    The Absolute Solver is the primary antagonist of Murder Drones, an ancient, hostile eldritch intelligence that seeks to consume all life by creating planet-destroying singularities. It first fully manifested through Cyn after her self-reboot, using her as a host to convert drones into Disassembly Drones and set in motion the destruction of humanity and multiple planets. Its influence spread to exoplanets like Copper 9 through infected Worker Drones, where only Yeva and Nori successfully became hosts, though Nori’s actions caused the planet’s core to collapse and left the Solver weakened. To finish its plan, the Solver manipulated and redeployed the Disassembly Drones to eliminate remaining threats and reclaim the planet. Ultimately, it was stopped by Uzi and her allies when Cyn was destroyed, trapping the Solver within Uzi and preventing it from completing its goal of planetary and human annihilation.
    <br><br>
    
    <div class="midtitle">The <?php echo $CHARNAME; ?>'s Physical Appearance</div>
    <br>
    As a computer program, the Solver does not, strictly speaking, have a physical form, though the AI uses a series of symbols when carrying out tasks.
    <br><br>
    
    <div class="submidtitle">Normal/Translate Symbol</div>
    <br>
    The base solver symbol is a hollow hexagon, with corners at the top. There are arrows coming out from the top, bottom-left, and bottom-right of the hollow hexagon. There is a smaller, filled-in hexagon inside the hollow one.
    <br><br>
    
    <div class="submidtitle">Scale Symbol</div>
    <br>
    The "Scale" symbol is nearly the same, except there is the double-hexagon at the ends of the arrows instead of triangles.
    <br><br>
    
    <div class="submidtitle">Rotate Symbol</div>
    <br>
    The "Rotate" symbol is the double-hexagon, inside of two intersecting diagonal ovals. That is surrounded by three layered hollowed circles, with multiple columns of three tiny dots at the edges.
    <br><br>
    
    <div class="submidtitle">Edit Symbol</div>
    <br>
    The "Edit" symbol is the double-hexagon inside of a hollow circle. There is a second, larger hollow circle around the first, creating a ring. Some parts of the ring are filled in.
    <br><br>
    
    <div class="submidtitle">The <?php echo $CHARNAME; ?>'s Personality</div>
    <br>
    The Absolute Solver presents itself as calm and unassuming when imitating its hosts, particularly Cyn or Tessa, but its true nature consistently reveals a dominant, arrogant, and sadistic personality. It frequently taunts those aware of its existence, behaving like a puppet master that treats its hosts as disposable tools while taking evident pleasure in its own power. Though capable of convincing deception—flawlessly mimicking Cyn’s meekness and Tessa’s reckless passion—it eventually drops these facades to reveal its cruel, cunning, and omnipotent demeanor. Its emotions appear limited mainly to anger and joy, depending on the success of its plans.
<br><br>
<div class= "submidtitle">The <?php echo $CHARNAME; ?>'s Biography </div>
  <br>
<div class= "submidtitle">Pre-Series</div>
  <br>
The origin of the eternal intelligence that would come to be known as the <?php echo $CHARNAME; ?> is unknown, with its earliest documented event being the infection of a Zombie Drone named Cyn, who self-rebooted after being improperly disposed of, implying that it originated as a consequence of either a virus or glitch in Cyn's systems. The instructional video on Zombie Drones in "Home" suggests that the <?php echo $CHARNAME; ?> has been at least known about by humanity some time prior to 3020, enough for it to be known that it manifests in 0.7% of Zombie Drones. Either way, the program manifested in her and used her to destroy Earth and most of the humans living on the planet.
<br>
    <br>
From there, it would spread to numerous human-inhabited exoplanets, infecting more drones to find new hosts. Its power only grew when the humans of Copper 9 allowed certain drones to be infected by the <?php echo $CHARNAME; ?> so they could better understand it. Drones like Yeva were deliberately infected, which, in her case, caused the <?php echo $CHARNAME; ?> to be passed down to her daughter.
<br>
    <br>
Unfortunately, the <?php echo $CHARNAME; ?> succeeded in finding a new host, a Worker Drone named Nori Doorman, whose infected code would be passed down to her daughter, Uzi. A patch to exorcise the <?php echo $CHARNAME; ?>’s influence was used on Yeva and Nori, although when it was used on Nori, it scrambled her memories and drove her mad.
<br>
    <br>
The <?php echo $CHARNAME; ?> sent Disassembly Drones to the planet by convincing them that they were sent by JCJenson to exterminate the escaped, corrupted AI in the form of Worker Drones. Their directives were to both wipe out the hosts of the <?php echo $CHARNAME; ?> such as Nori and Yeva cured by Crucifix Patch so they couldn't use Cyn's power against her and also get access to Cabin Fever Labs to find the patch and destroy it. After executing these directives, the <?php echo $CHARNAME; ?> will have no obstacles and will turn the core of Copper 9 into a black hole.
  <br>
  <br>
<div class= "submidtitle">PILOT</div>
  <br>
The <?php echo $CHARNAME; ?>’s existence is first hinted at in the Pilot, when N was slapped by J and forced into a brief system reboot. It weighed the prospect of coming online but was quickly made dormant again as N's administrative systems (CYN) reasserted themselves. The <?php echo $CHARNAME; ?> symbol makes a small cameo on Uzi's visor when J shoots bullets at Uzi. A similar line of code appears on Uzi's visor after she declares her intent to travel to Earth and kill all humans in retribution for them, sending the Disassembly Drones to slaughter them.
     <br>
  <br>
<div class= "submidtitle">Heartbeat</div>
  <br>
 Sometime after J was destroyed by Uzi, a Worker Drone named Frank is assigned to repair the hole in the ceiling created by N when he flew off with Uzi after her self-exile, along with the captive Serial Designation V. Frank hears several noises around the room and eventually notices J's broken shell having mysteriously moved. Soon after, he discovers her bio-mechanical core inside her corpse. J's Absolute Solver activates and transforms her corpse into an eldritch. It swiftly kills Frank and absorbs his remains. From there, it continues to assimilate more Worker Drones, using the holograms of its victims to lure others in.
<br><br>
Eventually, Uzi, N, and Thad arrive at the evacuation spot where Frank was killed. Uzi finds the meaning of the symbol on her face (shown after she was attacked by N during their first encounter) and learns that the <?php echo $CHARNAME; ?> caused the mysterious assimilation. This failsafe program exists inside the Disassembly Drones. Just when they are about to discover more of this program, Thad is grabbed by a human hand attached to a tentacle. N severs the tentacle, but a claw emerges from the darkness and drags Thad away.
<br><br>
When Uzi and N catch up, they find the <?php echo $CHARNAME; ?> trying to mimic Thad but see through it. After Thad is freed, the <?php echo $CHARNAME; ?> reveals its current host body, an enormous robotic centipede with J's head. Rather than banter with Uzi, the <?php echo $CHARNAME; ?> shows a brief hologram of Uzi's mother holding a baby Uzi, both sporting the Solver's glyph on their visors. It offers to assimilate Uzi, who refuses; the <?php echo $CHARNAME; ?> responds by killing a hologram of Khan in front of her to make her emotionally unstable so she will be unable to protect herself. It ambushes Uzi with a hologram of N and destroys her railgun, but before it can devour her, N uses his chainsaw hands to attack it and save Uzi. The railgun then explodes and destroys the eldritch monster.
<br><br>
Reduced once more to the core, the <?php echo $CHARNAME; ?> crawls out of the debris only to be repeatedly stabbed by N's Nanite Acid tail. Both the scraps of Eldritch J and the core implode and escape by turning into minuscule black holes.
<br><br>
At the end of the episode, it is revealed that at some point after J goes eldritch, it teleported in front of Uzi's class door and disguises as Lizzy through a hologram, attempting to lure the real Lizzy into opening the door. However, when Lizzy started walking towards the door in order to do so, Doll intervenes and destroys the door using her <?php echo $CHARNAME; ?>abilities, successfully preventing Lizzy from opening it. In response, the <?php echo $CHARNAME; ?> makes an angry expression before teleporting away.
    <br><br>
    <div class= "submidtitle">The Promening</div>
  <br>
Doll would be another individual to be shown as affiliated with the <?php echo $CHARNAME; ?>, which granted her unique abilities to create, modify, or otherwise tamper with matter of most kinds. She would use this in a fight against Uzi, and N. V shot her in the head before Uzi and N could gather any information, much to Uzi's annoyance. Doll would later reappear when the group investigated her home, pulling the bullet out of her head and attempting to kill Uzi with it. However, Uzi's Solver suddenly awakens, stopping the bullet in mid-air and deflecting it. A shocked and worried Doll promises to help her before teleporting away.
    <br><br>
     <div class= "submidtitle">Cabin Fever</div>
  <br>
Before Uzi set out on a field trip into Camp 98.7, Khan told her about a collar that both her mother and Doll's mother wore, which indicated what number host they were. While exploring the camp, she had some skill with her <?php echo $CHARNAME; ?> abilities, levitating a flashlight with no issue. However, when hiding in an abandoned cabin, her high temperature causes her to lose control of her Solver. When two of her classmates attempted to enter the cabin, she devoured one of them and bisected the other. In her consequent appearances, she gains a pair of organic bat-like wings with humanoid fingers and a tail with a mouth-like appendage. She also displays an X on her visor. By the end of the episode, Uzi had reverted to her regular form.
    <br><br>
      <div class= "submidtitle">Home</div>
  <br>
Sometime after the camping trip, Uzi hacks into N and V's unconscious minds because the Solver is attempting to erase N's memories of his life as a Worker Drone. In his head, N relives them without any memory of his present self or his meeting with Uzi. Uzi becomes a crow with the <?php echo $CHARNAME; ?> symbol as its iris when she is inside N's memories. She later hijacks a Solver camera, turning its eye purple.
 <br><br>
In this mindscape realm, she and N learn that the <?php echo $CHARNAME; ?> first manifested in Cyn, a fellow Worker Drone working with N, V, and J in the Elliott Manor as servants. Unlike the other Worker Drone servants, Cyn is unique due to her atypical behavior and physical deformities. She also has the same voice as Eldritch J. Cyn also narrates her actions out loud ("shuffle, shuffle" or "criss-cross applesauce").
 <br><br>
This caused her to be avoided by others around her, both humans and drones, except for N. Tessa Elliott, who, despite loving the Worker Drones (especially J and N), is quite unnerved and unfond of Cyn and instead tends to lock her away in the basement with J's help, Despite this, Cyn escapes.
 <br><br>
After Tessa's mother, Louisa, scolds her daughter and decides to have N, V, and J thrown into the dumpster tomorrow due to them "clogging the library," Cyn rebukes Louisa's statement of them being broken and states that they can no longer be "thrown out" as if threatening her.
 <br><br>
Angered by being talked back to by a Worker Drone, Louisa prepares to take her wrath out on Cyn, but N takes the fall for her. As punishment, N is chained to a tree to be destroyed by crows. Unfortunately, Tessa is punished by her mother for teaching her drones unacceptable behavior, along with J and Cyn, the latter of whom earns Tessa's anger because she believes N doesn't deserve to face the worst of her mother's anger for Cyn's sake.
 <br><br>
Despite this, Cyn assures Tessa that she has "backups" and decides to drop her façade by revealing her actual form to Tessa and J: a centipede-esque eldritch machine with multiple camera-like eyes surrounding it. As the <?php echo $CHARNAME; ?> symbol covers her visor, she tells Tessa to stay away from the gala held by her parents so that she will not have to toss her pets aside. In turn, Cyn will not toss her aside, despite her being human.
    <br><br>
     <div class= "submidtitle">Dead End</div>
  <br>
After Doll falls into Cabin Fever Labs, Uzi asks "Tessa" about the reason for Doll's involvement. "Tessa" says that Doll thinks the humans at Cabin Fever Labs experimented on her "folks," giving her a "sickness" she inherited. While staring eerily at Uzi, she adds that she thinks Doll is correct.
<br><br>
Later, Uzi attempts to free herself using her Solver abilities, but the magnet attached to her head stops her. Upon seeing this, Alice crawls toward Uzi and threateningly exclaims that she "dealt with witches" before, and she uses her knife to get a closer look at Uzi's choker, which previously belonged to her mother Nori.
<br><br>
When Alice tries to cut off Uzi's finger with a pair of pliers, Uzi desperately uses her Solver to stop the pliers, but her efforts are in vain. Meanwhile, outside, "Tessa" shows satellite footage of Earth to N. Much to his horror, it has been destroyed by a black hole. She elaborates that the Solver "mutates in damaged AI" and took Cyn as its first host, later taking "everything," showing pictures of Elliott Manor after Cyn's massacre.
<br><br>
She also says that the humans on Copper 9 saw the events on Earth and began deliberately infecting Drones with the Solver so they could understand it better. All it did was spread the Solver even further. N worriedly asks her if the Solver can be removed from Uzi; she solemnly responds that N will have to choose the universe over her before "she's not herself anymore."
<br><br>
As Uzi watches the Sentinels attack N and "Tessa" on camera, she desperately uses the Solver again. This time it works, but the Solver quickly takes control, changing Uzi's Solver hologram to be colored yellow, signifying the Solver's ever-growing control over her. To V's horror, she hears Cyn's familiar voice again, now coming from Uzi. Now almost completely possessed, Uzi summons a black hole that blows a hole in the wall and destroys the door controls. She returns to normal and passes out.
<br><br>
When the Sentinels ambush Alice, V tries to free herself and defend herself, but they are suddenly pulled into a black hole with flesh around it that then disappears and rots. The two reunite with "Tessa" and N and head to the secret elevator, where they see Doll boot-looped, lying motionless on the ground with the Keybug stuck in her hand. When Uzi uses her Solver to retrieve the bug from afar, she is suddenly stopped by N and V, who both frighteningly shout, "Don't!"
<br><br>
After falling for Doll's trap, the group prepares to battle against the Sentinels. Uzi blows a hole into the elevator using her Solver, much to N's dismay. She loses control again and creates a black hole with a fleshy mass on the elevator. As the black hole grows larger, N slices off Uzi's hand to disable the Solver. She staggers back, and her head suddenly twists toward him with yellow eyes and a sharp-toothed grin, with the text "MISS ME?" appearing beside her, foreshadowing Cyn's return. Uzi falls to the ground, her voice glitching and her eyes alternating from purple to yellow.
<br><br>
 <div class= "submidtitle">Mass Destruction</div>
  <br>
A hologram of V appears in front of N, trying to bring his guard down. It then showed Cyn, which caused N to have a flashback of when the Disassembly Drones were wiping out the human race on Earth. The Solver then proceeds to drag N onto the ground, only for Nori to save him and hand him the Crucifix Patch as she directs him through the tunnels as it chases them.
<br><br>
In another part of the underground lab, "Tessa" proceeded to look into the list of Worker Drones that were used as test subjects in the human's study of the <?php echo $CHARNAME; ?>, with it showing that every drone was either designated as "corrupted" or "no effect," with the only active two at the time being Nori and Yeva. Having gotten the necessary information, she proceeded to purge the system, causing the computer to self-terminate right as she caught an attack from Doll, who demanded the location of the Crucifix Patch to exorcise the Solver from her, saying that she refused to allow it to use her to consume the planet.
<br><br>
However, "Tessa" disappeared from Doll's line of sight as the fire was extinguished, leaving her alone in the darkness as strange noises were heard coming closer, putting Doll on high alert. On her visor, she sees something unusual coming towards her, and her attempts at using her own Solver against it prove useless due to the entity being "[like object non-interactable]". Realizing what was coming for her, Doll attempted to throw a boulder at the entity but failed to save herself as it tore it in half and lunged at her, severely wounding her.
<br><br>
Inside the cathedral, Uzi was left shocked upon witnessing the footage, and Doll came stumbling in slowly, leaving a trail of oil in her wake before she slipped and fell to the ground, succumbing to the damage, with her dying message to Uzi being "FIGHT BACK." This caused Uzi to become more worried until she noticed "Tessa" standing in the doorway behind her. Realizing the danger, Uzi tries to assure her that she didn't kill Doll, but when she attempts to use her Solver to defend herself against "Tessa," she receives the same error as Doll. However, before she could impale Uzi with her sword, N appeared and questioned if she knew about the Crucifix Patch and told her she only had one chance to give him answers, or else he would kill her.
<br><br>
Because she responded in a teasing manner, N immediately decapitated "Tessa" as her body stumbled slightly before falling to the ground. Despite his shock over his actions, N tried to help Uzi with the patch, however, Uzi began to laugh as she shattered the crucifix, and lifted her head to reveal her eyes had gone from purple to yellow, indicating that the Solver now was controlling her as it decided that N had served his purpose and that his backups would forgive "her" for doing away with him, only for Nori to intervene and shock "Uzi" as Nori was supposed to be dead, but Nori only responded by telling her she was grounded, making her angry.
<br><br>
Despite N's reluctance and the Solver nearly succeeding in using Uzi to eat Nori's core, N managed to distract her by explaining to Nori that he and her daughter "hang out," annoying her greatly as she scolded her for "hanging out" with the things that killed her mother, which managed to get Uzi to fight off the Solver's possession, but she ended up angrily drop kicking Nori into the chasm that led to the core of the planet as N revealed that thing was her mother, causing both of them to scream before they hugged. However, "Tessa" grabbed her decapitated head, putting it back and twisting it around the right way as she took off her spacesuit to reveal her true self. She began to feast on Doll's remains and ended up eating her core, ensuring she couldn't come back.
<br><br>
Horrified, Uzi and N looked as "Tessa" told them to get snuck up on, revealing that she was the Absolute Solver who melded what was left of Tessa's corpse with Cyn's body, creating a reanimated drone-human hybrid for itself as it attacked the two by biting N's neck and stabbing Uzi in the chest. It sarcastically thanked them for putting up quite a fight and dropped into the chasm that led to the core of Copper 9, now ready to finish what it started years ago.
<br><br>
It then summons a pair of tentacles to drag both N and Uzi into the pit, but the latter manages to save N by tossing him the keys to the spaceship J, and "Tessa" used to arrive on the planet before allowing herself to be dragged into the planet's core.
    <br><br>
    <div class= "submidtitle">Absolute End</div>
  <br>
The episode opens with fragments of Copper 9 flying into space, as the Solver's tentacles expand, looking to collect matter. One of the tentacles breaks into the ship piloted by N (who stole it from J), delivers a message from Cyn, who tells them "Stop :)". The tentacle then brings the remains of the ship to the fragment where J is sitting, where J begrudgingly thanks her "boss". V appears shortly after, and begins to fight J as she questions her on why she's working with Cyn - as a "Senior Informant." V tells J that if they did their jobs, the Solver would leave them alone, to which J replies that they were tricked.
    <br><br>
Falling from space, Uzi throws her purple [null] into the core of Copper 9, tearing a hole in the planet's surface and disrupting the Solver's assimilation process. As Uzi and N land on a platform, they are suddenly jolted as Cyn emerges from Copper 9's core riding on a tentacle. Cyn reveals that she caught Uzi's [null] before rolling it about her shoulder and crushing it, thereby allowing the Solver's assimilation of the planet to continue. Cyn steps onto the platform and greets Uzi with a menacing tone before saying hi to N with an endearing high-pitched voice.
    <br><br>
N and Uzi step back in response, the former pointing his laser cannon at Cyn. Cyn then remarks that N won't talk to her as she has hurt his feelings, and decides that it is easier to assimilate than explain, before distorting into a more eldritch form and running a callback ping. The ping disrupts Uzi's senses, temporarily turning her eyes yellow, but she resists and snaps at Cyn to bite her. Suddenly, a serrated tendril emerges from the fog and whips N away while Cyn lunges at Uzi upside-down - saying "Okee" in response.
    <br><br>
After effortlessly slicing Uzi's hand off, Cyn grabs her by the neck and plunges her hand into Uzi's torso, ripping out her heart. N screams and tries to stab Cyn from above, but Cyn teleports away and uses a tendril to rip his blade off; she pins N to the ground and rips off his other arm when he tries to attack with submachine gun fire. Cyn begins to tear through N's chest with her fingers, inadvertently decapitating him in the process. Uzi, now conscious again, uses her Solver power to break the platform and get away as Cyn grows a pair of wings. N and Uzi tumble down several platforms, and Cyn watches in amused glee as Uzi drags N into the labs before following them in.
    <br><br>
Inside the lab, Cyn is unable to detect N or Uzi and runs more callback pings. N has a brief recollection of him and V being experimented on by Cyn back at the manor. After failing to find them, Cyn starts to retreat until V enters the building. As V is calling for N, Cyn produces a fake N hologram which V mistakes for the real one, until N yells at V to stop. One of Cyn's hand-tentacles then pierces N's torso, grabs his heart, and pulls him away. As V sees the lifeless N being held by Cyn, Cyn reminds V of their agreement - V does her job, and Cyn leaves her and N alone. V begins to stammer, about to ask if she can still comply, until Cyn states she's done a bad job and starts chasing after her.
    <br><br>
Outside, J ambushes V and kicks her to the ground, as Cyn drops N's body next to her. Cyn then emerges from the lab entrance, laughing as she's about to devour N's heart while V watches in despair. However, Khan shuts the door on her at the last second, making Cyn lose her grip on N's heart, which conveniently flies into N's body. Annoyed, Cyn says "God fu-- d--mit." Cyn rolls her eyes as Thad throws Uzi's railgun, saying Uzi is not there, and the proceeds to charge at V and N's immobile body. Uzi stops her attack, and Cyn runs another callback ping, but this time is unable to get control of Uzi. Uzi gets ready to battle Cyn and J, which Cyn accepting casually ("'Kay.").
    <br><br>
As the battle starts, Uzi and Cyn launch their [null]s at each other. The two proceed to fight, with Uzi and Cyn using Nori's pickaxe and Tessa's sword, respectively. Cyn dodges J's head being launched at her and starts teleporting around the battlefield trying to attack Uzi. As Uzi is about to stab her, Cyn changes her appearance to make her believe she's stabbed N, only for the real N to interfere. Cyn returns to her hybrid form, throwing back the pickaxe at Uzi, as N, Uzi and V all charge at her. Cyn manages to dodge the machine gun fire and missiles shot at her, and distracts N by showing him a Golden Retriever on her eyes. Uzi attacks from behind, but Cyn quickly recovers and pins down Uzi, only for V to kick her back. V and Cyn then fight each other one-on-one until Cyn manages to corner her, only for Uzi to hit her from below while N is waiting behind.
    <br><br>
As the trio share a secret handshake, one of Cyn's tentacles hit N and V, launching them away. Cyn charges at Uzi again, but Uzi sees her about to teleport and turns around, managing to grab into Cyn's heart and tear it out. Uzi activates another [null], creating a hole through Copper 9, and using the sunlight coming through the hole to burn away Cyn's heart, as the screams of the people killed at the gala can be heard. After the heart is destroyed, a large black hole appears which envelops Uzi and Cyn and stops time outside of it. Cyn's hybrid form, starting to melt away, moves forward to devour the Solver's core again, only for Uzi to swallow the solver's core instead. A shocked emoji appears on Cyn's eyes in response. After the black hole disappears, the now-immobile hybrid form of Cyn and Tessa falls to its knees and melts into nothing right in front of Uzi, leaving behind only some of the deceased Tessa's human bones and marking the end of the drone known as "Cyn."
    <br><br>
However, the Solver was revealed to still exist as it spoke through Uzi's stinger tail, complimenting that she looks great and puts Tessa's bow on Uzi's head. Uzi says nothing and shuts her locker door.

    <div class="midtitle">Overview of <?php echo $CHARNAME; ?></div>
    <br>
    <?php echo $CHARNAME; ?> was a minor antagonist in Murder Drones and was voiced by Amber May. She was once a test subject at Cabin Fever Labs, alongside Nori, Yeva, and many other Worker Drones injected with the Solver's code. Beyond this, little else is known about her.
    <br><br>

    <div class="submidtitle"><?php echo $CHARNAME; ?>'s Physical Appearance</div>
    <br>
    <?php echo $CHARNAME; ?> has bright neon-orange eyes and dark reddish-brown hair tied into a ponytail, with her bangs parted to the right. She wears a worn grey dress typical of female Worker Drones, along with a V-shaped collar exposing her neon-orange Worker Drone symbol. She also has a long, makeshift black tail resembling that of a Disassembly Drone, though without acid, often wrapped around the handle of a kitchen knife.
    <br><br>

    She wears antlers mounted over her hard hat, decorated with scavenged items from the facility. Her left antler is adorned with silverware and an ID card bound by rope, while her right antler holds a pipe fitted with a lightbulb and a shard of glass acting as a makeshift mirror. She is also barefoot.
    <br><br>

    <div class="submidtitle"><?php echo $CHARNAME; ?>'s Personality</div>
    <br>
    <?php echo $CHARNAME; ?> is an extremely sadistic Worker Drone who enjoys scavenging body parts from other drones and adding them to her antlers. She is cruel toward her assistant Beau, frequently belittling them. She harbors a deep vendetta against Nori Doorman, which fuels her obsession with torturing Uzi despite knowing little about her. She also enjoys watching Sentinels slaughter drones through the facility cameras as if it were entertainment.
    <br><br>

    Despite her cold and sociopathic nature, <?php echo $CHARNAME; ?> is capable of fear, as shown when she witnesses the Absolute Solver possess Uzi and destroy the control panel sealing the doors.
    <br><br>

    <div class="submidtitle"><?php echo $CHARNAME; ?>'s Biography</div>
    <br>

    <div class="submidtitle">Pre-Series</div>
    <br>
    <?php echo $CHARNAME; ?> was once a test subject in the Cabin Fever project and was acquainted with Nori and Yeva, as seen in a photograph accessed from the office computer. After the Solver took control of Nori and destroyed organic life on Copper 9, Nori and Yeva escaped to the Worker Drone bunker.
    <br><br>

    <?php echo $CHARNAME; ?> remained behind in the underground offices of Cabin Fever Labs, collecting parts from drones killed by Sentinels and fashioning weapons to hunt intruders. She viewed Nori’s departure as betrayal and held onto her grudge ever since.
    <br><br>

    <div class="submidtitle">Dead End</div>
    <br>
    When Uzi, V, N, and “Tessa” infiltrated Cabin Fever Labs to retrieve the Secret Elevator key, <?php echo $CHARNAME; ?> captured them with an EMP blast, later discovering Uzi’s connection to Nori and beginning to torture her.
    <br><br>

    After N and “Tessa” escaped, <?php echo $CHARNAME; ?> released the Sentinels to hunt them for her amusement. However, the Absolute Solver briefly possessed Uzi and destroyed the control panel, allowing the Sentinels access to <?php echo $CHARNAME; ?>, who was boot-looped and killed when her head was crushed.

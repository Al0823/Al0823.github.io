 The voice of V is played by Nola Klop, V serves as a Tritagonist throughout the story. V's story is that she was once a Worker Drone, converted by the Absolute Solver into a Disassembly Drone and she was then sent to Copper 9 to destroy runaway AI embedded in the code of some the Worker Drones. V conflicts with N, Her colleague and past love interest N teams up with the rebellious Worker Drone Uzi, who wants to rebel against the company and humanity. This causes V to butt heads with N and Uzi until the three came across the Absolute Solver. The Absolute Solver is an immensely powerful artificial intelligence that afflicts Uzi's ablity to function and is connected to N and V's past.
 <br>
 <br>
 <div class="submidtitle">Serial Designation V-X001000000's Physical Form</div>
  <br>
  V has the features of a typical female Disassembly Drone. She has neon-yellow eyes and a silver bob-cut hairstyle. As with the other Disassembly Drones, she has a black headband with five cartridges of Nanite Acid and a long black tail ending in a large syringe containing Nanite Acid. She wears a black-gray, short-sleeved crop coat with a fur collar and cuffs. Her legs are painted black up to her thighs, resembling thigh-high socks, with yellow and black stripes at the end of her legs. she also accessories a yellow arm-band with a skull label on it, along with some text. The text containing her P/N (CYN-MYKX) and S/N (V-X00100000).
 <br>
  <br>
When she is hunting, her visor displays a neon yellow long 'X' shape and her mouth reveals her jagged teeth. She also deploys large bladed-sharp wings and sharp claws that can easily tear through any drone.
  <br>
  <br>
<div class="submidtitle">Serial Designation V-X001000000's Worker Form</div>
  <br>
  In N's flashback, V wore a black hard hat like the other worker drones, a black-grey maid dress paired with a bowtie around the neck with a button on the middle, and black knee-length stockings on both of her legs. She also wore an armband and black round glasses.
<br>
  <br>
As a Worker Drone, V had a very bad defect that drastically impacted her vision, to the point that glasses were the only way to fix it.
<br>
<br>
<div class="submidtitle">Serial Designation V-X001000000's Solver Form</div>
<br>
In this form, V grew large bat wings (similar to Uzi's solver form) and her right fingers were replaced with sharp claws. Her right hand also appeared fleshy and had a yellow large eye with a slit pupil on it. Her visor displayed an 'X' shape.
<br>
<br>
<div class="submidtitle">Serial Designation V-X001000000's Prom Outfit</div>
<br>
During prom, V wore a red-velvet, glittery, sleeveless dress with a slit on the right side of her dress.
<br>
<br>
<div class="submidtitle">Serial Designation V-X001000000's Camp Outfit</div>
<br>
At Camp 98.7, she wore a scoutmaster's outfit, which included a short-sleeved green shirt and shorts. She also wore a wide-brimmed campaign hat.
<br>
<br>
<div class="submidtitle">Serial Designation V-X001000000's Personality</div>
<br>
V, on the surface, appears as a sociopathic and sadistic mass murderer, who has no qualms or regrets for murdering worker drones. However, underneath this exterior lies a traumatized and complex individual who seeks to keep her friends safe at any cost.
<br>
<br>
In her past, she was a far more reserved individual, being quite shy and nervous around her then-love interest, N, with whom she shared a strong connection with. However, she never truly stood up for herself or her fellow drones, as J frequently abused N as she stood by.
<br>
<br>
When V became a Disassembly Drone, she adopted the persona of a mass murderer who found joy in the act of snuffing out life wherever the company required it, and she appears to have made this her default personality, even justifying some of her more moral actions as set-ups for more devious ones. However, this was mostly an act. On the other hand, she did kill several ostensibly innocent drones even after she joined Uzi in her pursuit of the Absolute Solver.
<br>
<br>
Despite her exterior ruthlessness, she did hold the capacity for empathy and particularly held a great deal of care for her colleague N, though she normally derided him under her "persona". She had such a great deal of care for N that she actively hid their traumatizing past from him to keep him sane, while also agreeing to carry out her duties as a Disassembly Drone under the condition that she and N would be left alone.
<br>
<br>
She eventually becomes a staunch ally of Uzi, even sacrificing herself to secure Uzi and N's escape. She even develops a best-friendship with Lizzy, a Worker Drone who she was originally planning to murder in the prom. While she does maintain an aloof and overall negative attitude towards Uzi, this also appears to be an act, which she maintains with Lizzy as well.
<br>
<br>
Due to her still retaining her original personality and past memories, V holds great fear for the Solver, killing Workers to satisfy and keep it from harming her and N. When V sees any host for the Solver (e.g. Uzi), she immediately becomes wary and starts to target them. This is seen when Uzi first uses her Solver abilities to stop Doll's bullet, and later when she shows horrific changes from her infection, which sends V into hunting her down.
<br>
<br>
 N is shown to love dogs, with his favorite breed being Golden Retrievers.
 <br>

  <div class= "submidtitle"> Serial Designation V-X001000000's Biography </div>
  <br>
<div class= "submidtitle">Pre-Series</div>
  <br>
  V is a sadistic Disassembly Drone who, in her past, was once a regular Worker Drone brought in by Tessa to repurpose her as a friend and maid at Elliott Manor, where she lived with N, J and the Absolute Solver possessing Cyn. It is implied through flashbacks that around this time, V and N developed a romantic interest in each other. V was among the first of her fellow manor Workers to have been corrupted with Solver powers by the titular AI, soon helping it massacre a gala at the mansion and eventually destroy the Earth. Afterward, V was rebuilt by the Solver to be a Disassembly Drone, and together with clones of N and J, a copy of V was sent to Copper 9 to eliminate all Workers found there.
  <br>
  <br>
  <div class= "submidtitle">PILOT</div>
  <br>
V makes her first appearance in a flashback with N, in which she is violently killing a Worker Drone. She laughs maniacally and states that she still feels nothing. After, N tries to start small-talk with her by commenting on the planet's toxic death storm, but V promptly snaps, "Oh god! Who are you?" before flying away. Back in the present, she arrives at the Disassembly Drone lair, spotting Uzi attempting to run away before stating "Yo! We got a worker out there I kinda want to practice balloon animal shapes with!". After saying this, V looks around the Spire and asks what happened, to which J replies that N must have tripped and gone offline. After J rebooted N's systems, N hurriedly ran away to retrieve and destroy Uzi's railgun. A flag sticks out from V's hand, reading "LITERALLY SO INSANELY SUSPICIOUS."
 <br>
  <br>
She reappears after N manages to get through the doors of the Worker Drones Bunker. She realizes that the ventilation shafts can take them right through the last door and flies into it to kill some Worker Drones. V is about to kill Thad when both N and Uzi arrive. A fight ensues between V and N while Uzi fights J. During the battle, N gets pinned down by V and sees that Uzi is about to get killed by J. He licks V's blade to disorient her, to which V expresses "Ew! What the hell?!" before N kicks her into the ground. V then gets tied up by N with her tail, and N takes her away with him as he leaves with Uzi back to the Landing Pod.
  <br>
  <br>
<div class= "submidtitle"> Heartbeat </div>
  <br>
  V appears in N's dream (actually a flashback) where she and N are Worker Drone servants at a mansion. V bumps into N, and they then exchange a spark at their hands as both of them touch. V and N look nervously at each other before J suddenly kicks N, interrupting the interaction.
<br>
<br>
In the present, V is inside the pod with Uzi, chained up and blowing bubbles. After Uzi shatters a mirror because of the Absolute Solver, V calls it "weird and concerning." V would later question Uzi's innocence when the latter wishes to kill all humans in an attempt to provoke Uzi. A fight almost ensues, but N quickly pulls Uzi away from V.
<br>
<br>
After Uzi and N's fight with Eldritch J, N returns to the pod feeling upset, during which V asks why she is being punished and states she hates his normal personality. As N remains silent, and despite her words, V briefly shows sympathy for him and adjusts her broken chains to make them look intact. Though annoyed, she remains in the pod to accompany N. At around this time, a certain worker drone is shown staring at a printout of a photo of V.
<br>
<br>
<div class= "submidtitle"> The Promening </div>
<br>
V is in the pod with N and two human skeletons (one wearing a tuxedo and the other wearing a dress) that N brought as per V's request. V explains her plan to trick Uzi into letting both N and herself into the prom so she can kill everyone there for "prom murder", but N refuses to let V go through with it. After N tells her about J's eldritch transformation and the dream he had about his past, V worriedly asks him to stop prying into those matters and says that if he lets her go to the prom, she and N will only kill what is necessary to survive. N then asks V if she is hiding anything and what is it that she knows; V responds by slicing N's head off mid-sentence, stating that she knows "what's best for you, even if you hate me for it". With her chain broken, she steals the dress from one of the skeletons and heads to the bunker to kill all the Worker Drones at the prom.
<br>
<br>
V arrives at the bunker, where Lizzy let her inside. At the prom, V flies down from the ceiling and lands on the prom stage in her red dress, which shocks and scares many students there. V is introduced by Lizzy and is proclaimed the prom queen by default since the other contestants (who were killed by Doll) have disappeared. Lizzy then tells her fellow students that V has changed and is no longer a threat, and that the two have been hanging. V then starts to walk forward to the microphone while talking about the gullible nature of the Worker Drones. She is about to go on a murderous rampage before realizing she is the prom queen. Upon realizing this, V decides to instead murder the students after the prom (justifying it to herself saying it's extra-sinester this way) and walks up to the microphone to give a speech. Suddenly, N and Uzi arrive through the roof thinking they need to stop V from murdering the students - only to be surprised when she's not doing so. Lizzy then decides to betray Doll and yells to V to escape before Doll kills her. Doll suddenly uses her powers to pry wires from under the stage and force them through V's arms, pinning her in place.
<br>
<br>
Trapped, Doll forces V to remember the murder of Doll's parents (that V committed) and then stabs another wire through her chest. V manages to free her right arm and begins shooting at Doll with her submachine gun hand. However, her attempt is futile, as her bullets are deflected by Doll. Doll then throws a cleaver at her, slicing V's arm off. She forces a fan blade off the roof and throws it at V, but N knocks it away before it can harm her. Uzi then tries to reason with Doll, stating that fighting won't get them anywhere. Doll is seemingly unaffected by these words and is only focused on killing V. Because Uzi and N are in the way, she decides to kill all three at once by throwing two other fan blades at them, but N pushes Uzi out of the way. This resulted in both him and V being dismembered.
<br>
<br>
Both N and V are retrieving their body parts as Uzi fights Doll. When N grabs a disembodied arm, V snatches it back with her mouth, claiming it is hers. Upon seeing this, Lizzy expresses her disgust and says V looks "like garbage". V snaps and calls Lizzy a "frickin traitor". Lizzy responds by stating that V had been manipulating her and was planning to kill everyone during prom. N thanks Lizzy for confronting her, but she and V tell him to shut up. V manages to put her body back together and sneaks up behind Doll as she makes her last stand against N and Uzi. As Doll is preparing to attack the two, V shoots Doll in the head, seemingly killing her. Uzi voices her displeasure with Doll being shot since she wanted to get some information out of her, and N claims V is overdramatically hiding something.
<br>
<br>
Upon entering Doll's home, they find numerous dismembered Worker Drone corpses scattered about. V is seen chewing and sucking on a dismembered arm, which Uzi removes from her mouth. While exploring the dining room, N finds the corpses of Doll's parents, and V comments that they "literally didn't even taste that good"; N tells V that she "sucks" in response, to which V agrees. Doll then teleports into the room, pulling the bullet out of her head and firing it at Uzi, but Uzi stops the bullet mid-air with her awakened Absolute Solver abilities. In that moment of Uzi being almost shot, V is seen with a perplexed/concerned expression, pointing a gun at Uzi's direction, not knowing whether to shoot. When Doll realizes that Uzi also possesses the Absolute Solver, she pities Uzi and agrees to help her, provided she can find what she is searching for. She then teleports away right as V fires a missile at her.
<br>
<br>
<div class= "submidtitle"> Cabin Fever </div>
<br>
N and V both arrive dressed as scoutmasters, where V shoots a student. After Thad and Lizzy back them up, the two go on to keep the Uzi's classmates busy during their field trip at Camp 98.7, as their real mission is to have Uzi investigate and discover more about the Absolute Solver and catch Doll. V reveals that she is suspicious of Uzi because of her involvement with the Absolute Solver. She then warns Uzi to focus on her investigation rather than spying on the squad, even going as far as threatening to kill her if she is to be seen near the group again. V also tells her that N would quickly move on from her death.
<br>
<br>
V and the students again notice Uzi when N clumsily shouts for her to come out of hiding. Braidon, out of fear, accidentally shoots an arrow at Uzi. Luckily, she stops it mid-air with her Absolute Solver abilities. But, due to her overheating, she loses control of her powers, and the arrow mutates into a fleshy, sentient creature, much to V's horror - who seems to recognize the creature. Uzi then runs off with V trying to go after her, but N gets in the way. As V claims that "that THING" will leave them alone if they do their jobs, N scolds her for not telling him what's going on, surprising V. N tells V to keep watch of the students and flies away to look for Uzi. But V, now frustrated, tells them to do whatever they want and goes off to pursue and murder Uzi.
<br>
<br>
V then reappears to stop a now out-of-control, monstrous Uzi from killing Lizzy - though V adds that she came to kill Uzi, not to save Lizzy. V approaches Uzi, referring to her as "Cyn." Uzi whimpers and wishes to talk to N, but V wants to ensure she can never do that. An enraged Uzi succumbs to her violence, leading her to ambush and overpower V, dismembering her left arm in the process. Just as Uzi is about to stab V to death with her Nanite Acid syringe, N appears and prevents her from doing so by tossing Uzi into the sky. N then scolds V for her actions and flies off to have a comforting talk with Uzi, leaving V alone and upset at him for taking Uzi's side.
<br>
<br>
When Uzi and N land, V prepares for her rematch against Uzi but notices that N has her under control. She eases up, but Lizzy reappears and expresses her disgust towards N and V. V warns her not to patronize her, but Lizzy calls her a "diva" and walks away, to which V rolls her eyes and chuckles slightly. Uzi, N, and V later return to the bus with the remaining campers. The teacher asks about the other missing campers, to which V takes the blame for Uzi's killings by claiming that she ate them because she was simply hungry.
<br>
<br>
<div class="submidtitle"> Home </div>
<br>
The episode unfolds in V and N's memories as worker drones in Elliott Manor. At the start of the episode, V is in the library, standing motionless with ERROR 606 and an 'X' repeatedly flashing on her visor as N reads to her about Golden Retrievers from a book titled "101 Dog Breeds". After N witnesses a few books coincidentally falling from the shelves, as well as movements coming from the basement entrance behind V, he decides to leave the library.
<br>
<br>
Later, when N comes in contact with Uzi (in the form of a crow), he makes his way toward the supposed "scary basement." V is found standing above the entrance of said basement. N gently pulls V aside but discovers that a key is needed to enter the basement. As N and Uzi realize that the key is with J, V giggles while showing a wide, sharp-teethed grin, her visor displaying an 'X' shape. Her right hand has also changed, with her now having claws and a yellow eye on the back.
<br>
<br>
N and Uzi run to Tessa and J to obtain the key. However, V, now possessed by the Solver and with wings, follows them. J and Tessa fight V to distract her as N and Uzi run back to the basement to unlock it. However, V escapes the fight and follows the two to the basement. As Uzi manages to hijack a Solver camera, she notices V standing nearby. Uzi quickly drags N into the basement and locks themselves inside, preventing V from entering.
<br>
<br>
Present-day Solver manages to reclaim control of her Eldritch sentience from Uzi and lets V into the basement. She demands V grab a scalpel that the Absolute Solver would use to delete N's memories. V struggles to see the scalpel, having persistent difficulty picking it up with her claws as the Absolute Solver becomes more frustrated with her. N, however, calms the Absolute Solver down and hands V her glasses (now broken, from when she dropped them earlier) so that she can see better. She then grabs the scalpel with ease but becomes saddened. Seemingly broken free from the Solver's control, she repeats N's words about Golden Retrievers that he read to her earlier.
<br>
<br>
Touched, N tries to finish her sentence, but the Absolute Solver disarms V and pins her to the ceiling before insisting that she'll just delete their OS. V regains consciousness from the Solver's control and yells N's name in dismay as the Absolute Solver is about to delete his memories once again. However, Uzi regains control of the Eldritch sentience right before N is "executed." She then releases V and she plummets to the ground coughing. N gets up from the chair to check on V. They smile at each other before eventually regaining their current memories. N recognizes Uzi and thanks her, but V shouts in annoyance for her to get out of her head.
<br>
<br>
N and V return to their Disassembly Drone sentience in the real world (as Uzi gains admin rights over both of them). They look at each other before V turns her head away from N, blushing in embarrassment. She angrily stares at Uzi before switching her hand into a chainsaw. Later, V, N, and Uzi go outside, stumbling upon Tessa, J, and Doll, who are about to venture to Cabin Fever Labs. They all look at each other before showing their equal confusion as the episode abruptly ends.
<br>
<br>
<div class="submidtitle"> Dead End </div>
<br>
After a short talk with Tessa and the new J, V and the others make their way through Cabin Fever Labs after Doll steals the Keybug. As they explore the place, V is captured alongside N, Uzi, and Tessa by Alice and Beau, where she is strapped down to a hospital bed and immobilized with a magnet. V looks proud at Uzi after Alice says that "some parts are more valuable than others". V is then forced to watch as Alice experiments on Uzi.
<br>
<br>
Later on, Uzi gets possessed by the Absolute Solver and destroys the doors' control panel, allowing the Sentinels into the room. Beau then has last-second change of heart, releasing V and sacrificing himself so that she can escape. V then goes to free Uzi but gets cornered by two Sentinels. As she prepares to protect herself and Uzi, a barely-conscious Uzi activates her Absolute Solver to assimilate the Sentinels into an organic mess and save V. Realizing what's happened, V pensively looks at Uzi for a moment and picks her up. Once they reunite with Tessa, V angrily berates her for not being able to keep the Sentinels under control like she said she could. Tessa admits that she has not been honest with her like how she was with N. V stares at Tessa, her anger turning into concern. She is later seen on an elevated platform with her group, aiming her submachine gun at the red-eyed Sentinel that bit Tessa earlier.
<br>
<br>
As she drops down, she notices Doll lying on the ground, seemingly boot-looped, with the Keybug in her hand. Uzi comments on how convenient that was but V instead states that Doll has set up a trap. Uzi disregards her warning and pushes V away, trying to use her Absolute Solver powers to retrieve the Keybug from a distance. N suddenly stops her, and he and V look at each other - realizing what the other one knows. The three then notice Tessa with the Keybug already in her hand, and they slowly approach her with V leading the way, arming herself with two submachine guns. When she sees N and Uzi holding hands, she expresses her disgust; in response, Uzi calls V mean.
<br>
<br>
Suddenly, the previously feigning Doll takes advantage of the situation to steal the Keybug while also releasing Sentinels to the location of the group. She places the Keybug on the reader and jumps down an elevator shaft; an elevator then drops down, cutting them off from Doll. As Tessa prepares to battle the Sentinels, V is seen crawling up the walls to the ceiling.
<br>
<br>
The red-eyed sentinel fires a bullet at Tessa from a Dissassembly Drone hand, and V (now wearing her broken glasses from the flashback in the previous episode) manages to catch it and redirect it back to the sentinel. Tessa, Uzi, and N rush into the elevator, but as they do so, it begins to jolt and lurch as if about to fall. N worriedly asks V to enter the elevator quickly before it drops without her, but she is occupied with battling the red-eyed Sentinel. As she is about to kill the red-eyed Sentinel, she notices another one ahead of her. The Sentinel bites off the keybug reader, which forces the elevator back up. The same Sentinel flashes the boot-loop light at V; her glasses fall off when looking away and are destroyed by another advancing Sentinel.
<br>
<br>
Despite N's pleas to not give herself up because they need her, V slices the cables of the elevator to make it drop as more Sentinels surround her. She salutes Uzi, trusting that she can resolve this. The elevator cables snap as the Sentinels are about to attack, disconnecting V from everyone else. The elevator plummets towards the underground, and V, seemingly accepting her fate, continues to fight the Sentinels.
<br>
<br>
<div class= "submidtitle"> Mass Destruction </div>
<br>
Lizzy is shown texting an "secret friend" about J's arrival at the Spire. When N encounters the Absolute Solver in the tunnels, the Solver uses Worker Drone V's appearance to taunt him, and tell him he's the one of the reasons the Absolute Solver kept his team's personalities. V later reappears in N's flashback of him and the other Disassembly Drones slaughtering the human race.
<br>
<br>
<div class="submidtitle"> Absolute End </div>
<br>
V reappears in this episode, after being presumed dead earlier, when she blocks a missile shot by J towards Lizzy and Thad. Riding on the red-eyed sentinel that she's apparently tamed (who's wearing Beau's hat), V proceeds to fight J and question her on her betrayal towards her and N. J tells her that the Solver tricked them all. J admits that if she promised V anything else, then it tricked her too and fires a missile at V, causing her to fall. J chops off V's left lower leg and reaches out her hand, persuading her to join her and the Absolute Solver. V takes her hand, only to chop it off as she says "Oh, how about you bite me!" The two continue to fight as N and Uzi drop down and launch a composed black hole at the Absolute Solver.
<br>
<br>
Later, while the Absolute Solver goes after Uzi and N, J rescinds her previous offer to V, kicking down and immobilizing her, and then coldly telling V she never needed neither N or her before shooting a missile. As the Absolute Solver is tracking down N and Uzi, N has a brief recollection of him and V being experimented on by the Absolute Solver back in the manor. After escaping the fight with J, V enters the labs and starts calling out for N, explaining that J tricked both of them, and that the Absolute Solver possibly tricked J. V then spots a holographic version of N created by the Absolute Solver (who was unable to locate N and Uzi). Thinking it's the real N, she tearfully apologizes for not being fully honest with him, admitting that she greatly feared for the two of them, especially N. This prompts the real N to yell for V to stop, giving away his position to the Absolute Solver. The Solver then proceeds to pierce N's torso from behind, grab his heart, and drag him into the hallway she and V are in. V gasps in shock upon seeing the Absolute Solver holding N's heart and corpse, and the Absolute Solver tells V about how she promised to leave them both alone as long as V did her job, causing V to stammer. V is about to ask if she can still comply with the Absolute Solver's orders to save N, but the Absolute Solver refuses and tells V she's failed. The Solver then starts chasing after her.
<br>
<br>
Outside V, is attacked by J and kicked into the ground, with the Absolute Solver throwing N's body right next to her. V then watches in horror as the Absolute Solver is about to devour N's heart, when Khan shuts the door on the Absolute Solver from a distance, releasing her grip on N's heart - which conveniently lands in N's chest. The Absolute Solver then charges at V and the immobile N to kill them both, as V braces herself and tries to protect N's heart with her left hand. However, Uzi steps in at the last moment to block the Absolute Solver's attack, and tells her that no one can traumatize V or N but her. Uzi tells V "Glad you're not dead or whatever." in her usual tone, but then looks back at V and smiles, with V returning the smile as well.
<br>
<br>
The final battle then begins. When the Absolute Solver tries to trick Uzi into thinking she stabbed N with the pickaxe, J gets ready to attack Uzi from behind while Uzi is distracted. V and N cover her, with V exclaiming J chose the wrong team as she shoots a missile at her, knocking J into the labs. The trio then changes at the Absolute Solver, and V fires her missiles and machineguns at the Absolute Solver from above. When the Absolute Solver gets a grip on Uzi, V proceeds to fly and kick into her head, smugly smiling at Uzi as Uzi rolls her eyes. N then throws the Absolute Solver up in the air, and V intercepts her and throws her into the ground. While N and Uzi are distracted coming up with a secret handshake, V is left alone fighting the Absolute Solver, where she gets pinned to a wall - leading Uzi into uppercutting the latter. V briefly expresses confusion at the secret handshake, until the Absolute Solver hits both her and N and sends them flying away.
<br>
<br>
After Uzi destroys the Absolute Solver's heart, all that's left is a giant black hole which paused time (but didn't pause V and N). Uzi blacks out after consuming the black hole, which sends V and N into finding her. After they locate her, N and Uzi share a brief moment of happiness before V hits N to signal him to stop. V then becomes alarmed and aims her gun at Uzi when she notices the latter's new purple-yellow eyes. After Uzi calls herself a "damaged OC", V acknowledges it really is her and the three continue their reunion.
<br>
<br>
The episode then cuts to the classroom where it shows that Uzi was doing a presentation on the events of the show, with V and Lizzy booing at her after she finishes. V then gets a paper airplane thrown at her, showing the trio drawn in manga style from a smug N who is learning about manga art. This causes V to smile, which makes her slam her hand on Lizzy's face to keep her from commenting.
<br>
<br>
During the credits, she is seen at Doll's funeral, playing chess with the red-eyed sentinel - and apparently losing - while Lizzy hangs with them and V wears Beau's hat, and later in some kind of fight with her and Lizzy on one side, and N, Uzi, and Thad on the other side.

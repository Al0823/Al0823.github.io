		Murder Drones is a fictional series made by Liam Vickers and Glitch Productions, it takes place on Copper 9. Copper 9 is a terrestrial exoplanet colonized by the JCJenson corporation, valued at least in part for mining operations, industrial manufacturing, and robot research. But unfortunately the planet's core collapsed which also reduced the planets surface to a frozen wasteland. This killed all biological life on the planet, but it allowed the "rogue" worker drones to gain sentience and maintain a society. The Absolute Solver posing as the JcJenson company did not like that and sent at least 3 Disassembly Drones to exterminate all Worker Drones.

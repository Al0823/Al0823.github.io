<h2>"Assignment" Javascript tutorial</h2>
<br><br>


This is the "Assignment" Javascript page, it teaches you how to write this code and how it works.
Now what this code can do is change what some text says, it can also make buttons and just possibly redirects you if you know what you are doing.
<br><br>

<textarea id="textbox" name="textbox" rows="30" cols="70">
[input]

<p id="ASSIGNMENTS"></p>

<script>
let x = 67;
document.getElementById("ASSIGNMENTS").innerHTML = "Value of x is: " + x;
</script>

<p id="ASSIGNMENTS2"></p>

<script>
let y = 50
let x = 17 + y;
document.getElementById("ASSIGNMENTS2").innerHTML = x;
</script>

The simple assignment operator (=) assigns a simple value to a variable.

<p id="ASSIGNMENTS3"></p>

<script>
let x = 10;
x += 57;
document.getElementById("ASSIGNMENT3").innerHTML = x;
</script>

The addition assignment operator adds a value to a variable.

<p id="ASSIGNMENTS4"></p>

<script>
let x = 10;
x -= 5;
document.getElementById("ASSIGNMENTS4").innerHTML = "Value of x is: " + x;
</script>

The subtraction assignment operator subtracts a value from a variable.

<p id="ASSIGNMENTS5"></p>

<script>
let x = 10;
x *= 5;
document.getElementById("ASSIGNMENTS5").innerHTML = "Value of x is: " + x;
</script>

The multiplication assignment operator multiplies a variable by whatever is where 5 is located.

<p id="ASSIGNMENTS6"></p>

<script>
let x = 10;
x **= 5;
document.getElementById("ASSIGNMENTS6").innerHTML = "Value of x is: " + x;
</script>

The exponentiation assignment operator raises a variable by in this case what would be "5"

<p id="ASSIGNMENTS67"></p>

<script>
let x = 67;
x /= 1;
document.getElementById("ASSIGNMENTS67").innerHTML = x;
</script>

The Division Assignment Operator divides a variable by 5 in this case.

<p id="ASSIGNMENTS7"></p>

<script>
let x = 135;
x %= 68;
document.getElementById("ASSIGNMENTS7").innerHTML = "Value of x is: " + x;
</script>

The remainder operator assigns a remainder to a variable.

<p id="ASSIGNMENTS8"></p>

<script>
let x = "67";
let y ="Hello"
document.getElementById("ASSIGNMENTS8").innerHTML = x, y;
</script>

The basic assignment operator assigns values to variables.

<p id="ASSIGNMENTS9"></p>

<script>
let text = "I like";
text += "67";
document.getElementById("ASSIGNMENTS9").innerHTML = text;
</script>

The addition assignment operator can be used to add strings.

<h2>LOGICAL AND ASSIGNMENT</h2>

<p id="ASSIGNMENTS10"></p>

<script>
let x = true;
let y = x &&= 10;

document.getElementById("ASSIGNMENTS10").innerHTML = "Value of y is: " + y;
</script>

<p id="ASSIGNMENTS11"></p>

<script>
let x = false;
let y = x &&= 5;

document.getElementById("ASSIGNMENTS11").innerHTML = "Value of y is: " + y;
</script>

<p id="ASSIGNMENTS12"></p>

<script>
let x = 1;
let y = x &&= 10;

document.getElementById("ASSIGNMENTS12").innerHTML = "Value of y is: " + y;
</script>

<p id="ASSIGNMENTS13"></p>

<script>
let x = 0;
let y = x &&= 10;

document.getElementById("ASSIGNMENTS13").innerHTML = "Value of y is: " + y;
</script>

<p id="ASSIGNMENTS14"></p>

<script>
let x = undefined;
let y = x &&= 10;

document.getElementById("ASSIGNMENTS14").innerHTML = "Value of y is: " + y;
</script>

<p id="ASSIGNMENTS15"></p>

<script>
let x = null;
let y = x &&= 10;

document.getElementById("ASSIGNMENTS15").innerHTML = "Value of y is: " + y;
</script>

The Logical and Assignment operator is used between two values.
<br>
If the first value is correct/true, then the second value is assigned.

<h2>LOGICAL OR ASSIGNMENT</h2>

<p id="ASSIGNMENTS16"></p>

<script>
let x = false;
let y = x ||= 10;

document.getElementById("ASSIGNMENTS16").innerHTML = "Value of y is: " + y;
</script>

<p id="ASSIGNMENTS17"></p>

<script>
let x = true;
let y = x ||= 10;

document.getElementById("ASSIGNMENTS17").innerHTML = "Value of y is: " + y;
</script>

<p id="ASSIGNMENTS18"></p>

<script>
let x = null;
let y = x ||= 10;

document.getElementById("ASSIGNMENTS18").innerHTML = "Value of y is: " + y;
</script>

<p id="ASSIGNMENTS19"></p>

<script>
let x = undefined;
let y = x ||= 10;

document.getElementById("ASSIGNMENTS19").innerHTML = "Value of y is: " + y;
</script>

The Logical and Assignment operator is used between two values.
<br>
If the first value is incorrect/false, then the second value is assigned.





<p id="ASSIGNMENTS20"></p>

<script>
let x;
x ??= 10;

document.getElementById("ASSIGNNMENTS20").innerHTML = "x is: " + x; 
</script>

<p id="ASSIGNMENTS21"></p>

<script>
let x = 0;
x ??= 10;

document.getElementById("ASSIGNMENTS21").innerHTML = "x is: " + x; 
</script>

<p id="ASSIGNMENTS22"></p>

<script>
let x = 0;
x ??= 10;

document.getElementById("ASSIGNMENTS22").innerHTML = "x is: " + x; 
</script>

<p id="ASSIGNMENTS23"></p>

<script>
let x = undefined;
x ??= 10;

document.getElementById("ASSIGNMENTS23").innerHTML = "x is: " + x; 
</script>

<p id="ASSIGNMENTS24"></p>

<script>
let x = 10;
let y = 5
x ??= 10;

document.getElementById("ASSIGNMENTS24").innerHTML = "x is: " + x; 
</script>

The Nullish Coalescing Assignment operator is used between two values.

If the first value is not defined or null, the second value is assigned.

<p id="ASSIGNMENTS25"></p>

<script>
let text = "12345";
let min = Math.min(...text);
let max = Math.max(...text);

document.getElementById("ASSIGNMENTS25").innerHTML =
"Minimum is: " + min + "<br>Maximum is: " + max;
</script>

The "..." operator splits iterables into individual elements.

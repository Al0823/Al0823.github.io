<h2>LET Javascript tutorial</h2>
<br><br>


This is the "LET" Javascript page, it teaches you how to write this code and how it works.
Now what this code can do is change what some text says, it can also make buttons and just possibly redirects you if you know what you are doing.
<br><br>

<textarea id="textbox" name="textbox" rows="30" cols="70">
[input]

<p id="LET"></p>
<script>

{
  let x = 2;
}

let x = 67;

document.getElementById("LET").innerHTML = "The value of x is" x;


</script><br>

"let" statements will not work outside of the squiggly brackets. If it was working, x would equal 2. They do not work because they are apart of the block scope.<br>

<p id="LET2"></p>
<script>

{
  var y = 2;
}

let x = 65;

let z = x + y;

document.getElementById("LET2").innerHTML = "The value of z is" + z;


</script><br>

"let" statements will not work outside of the squiggly brackets but "var" statments will. This is because "VAR" statements are old, also because they are apart of the global scope.<br>

<p id="LET3"></p>
<script>

let x = "Skibidi";

let x = 67;

document.getElementById("LET3").innerHTML = x;


</script>

Variables defined with "let" cannot be redeclared.<br>

<p id="LET4"></p>
<script>

var x = "Skibidi";

var x = 67;

document.getElementById("LET4").innerHTML = x;


</script>

Variables defined with "var" can be redeclared. Redeclaring a variable with "var" inside a block will also redeclare the variable out side the block, this can impose problems. But using a "let" statement instead can fix this issue.<br>

<p id="LET5"></p>

<script>
let x = 67;   // Allowed

{
  let x = 34 + 33;   // Allowed
}

{
  let x = 2 * 33.5;   // Allowed
}

Declaring "let" statements alone in separate blocks is safe though.
document.getElementById("LET5").innerHTML = x;
</script>
[/input]
</textarea>

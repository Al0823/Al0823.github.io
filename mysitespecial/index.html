<font size="5">
Murder Drones is a fictional series made by Liam Vickers and Glitch Productions, it takes place on Copper 9. Copper 9 is a terrestrial exoplanet colonized by the JCJenson corporation, valued at least in part for mining operations, industrial manufacturing, and robot research. But unfortunately the planet's core collapsed which also reduced the planet's surface to a frozen wasteland. This killed all biological life on the planet, but it allowed the "rogue" worker drones to gain sentience and maintain a society. The Absolute Solver posing as the JcJenson company did not like that and sent at least 3 Disassembly Drones to exterminate all Worker Drones.

This website is the first ever website I built, except this version is special because it is for the First Anniversary of it. What makes it different from the normal one is that it will be made using only code that existed before the year 2000, so it is a celebration and a fun challenge.

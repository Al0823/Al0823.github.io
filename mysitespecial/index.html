    <font size="5">
    Murder Drones is a fictional series made by Liam Vickers and Glitch Productions. 
    It takes place on Copper 9, a terrestrial exoplanet colonized by the JCJenson corporation, 
    valued at least in part for mining operations, industrial manufacturing, and robot research. 
    But unfortunately the planet's core collapsed, reducing the planet&#39;s surface to a frozen wasteland. 
    This killed all biological life on the planet, but it allowed the "rogue" worker drones to gain sentience and maintain a society. 
    The Absolute Solver, posing as the JCJenson company, sent at least 3 Disassembly Drones to exterminate all Worker Drones.

    This website is the first ever website I built. This special version is for the First Anniversary. 
    What makes it different from the normal one is that it is built using only code that existed before the year 2000, 
    a celebration and a fun challenge.
